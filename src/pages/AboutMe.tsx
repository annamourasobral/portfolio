            I'm from Brazil and moved to Denmark due family reunification, I
            discovered my passion for programming when I did a classic game from
            Atari, called FREEWAY. I felt powerful when I programmed a simple
            but interesting game with a few hours of learning, and wondered
            where I could go with more knowledge.
